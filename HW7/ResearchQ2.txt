Research why you're able to call the default implementation of a method in 
an interface with some weird syntax. Here's the code:

public class blah{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		A a = new A();
		a.someMethod();
	}
}

interface myinterface{
	default public void sayHello(){
		System.out.println("Hello");
	}
}

class A implements myinterface{
	public void someMethod(){
		myinterface.super.sayHello();
	}
}

Again, your answer must provide sources.

Answer: "But what if we would like to call the default implementation
		of [the] method foo() from interface A instead of implementing our own. 
		It is possible to refer to refer to A and foo()" with super();
