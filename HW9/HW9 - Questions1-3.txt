1. Unable to instantiate Object class.
	May have been cause by a corrupt java.lang file.
 
2. We saw that with the notifyAll() uncommented, and the keyword 
synchonized removed from the method declarations, the program just died 
without throwing any exceptions. Given that we are working with an 
infinite loop here, that shouldn't have happened. Explain that.
	When the NotifyAll() ran, it was throwing an unchecked except which would not have to be handled. But since it does throw some sort of exception, the corresponding "public void run()" catches it and since we did not write any actions to be done when a Throwable is caught, the program just dies. 

3. Figure out how you'd fix it. Research how to have two threads share an object's monitor and fix the code.
	(Addition of the "synchronized" to both producer and consumer methods)
